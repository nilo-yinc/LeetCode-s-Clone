# ⚙️ LeetCode Clone 

This project is a **frontend implementation** of a coding platform inspired by **LeetCode**, built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It serves as the foundation of an ongoing **full-stack + GenAI powered project** that aims to replicate key functionalities of online coding platforms — from editor interface to AI-powered problem-solving assistance.

> 🛠️ **Note:** This repository currently includes only the frontend (UI/UX) components. Full-stack development including backend APIs, code execution engine, authentication, and GenAI integration is under active development and planned in upcoming phases.
